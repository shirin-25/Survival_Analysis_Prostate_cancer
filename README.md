# Survival Analysis Prostate Cancer

This project is part of our coursework in Survival Analysis, where our group conducted a survival analysis on prostate cancer data. The primary goal of this project is to understand the factors influencing the survival rates of prostate cancer patients and to apply statistical techniques to analyze survival times.

Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on prostate cancer datasets.
Apply Kaplan-Meier estimators to estimate survival functions.
Use Cox proportional hazards models to identify significant predictors of survival.
Interpret the results and draw meaningful conclusions about prostate cancer survival.

Summary 
​​
1) Descriptive Analysis 
2)	Summary survival statistics	
3)	Survival curves plots and curves comparison	
4)	Non-parametric estimation of survival of 1 or more groups	
5)	Nonparametric comparison of 2 or more groups	
6)	Semi-parametric Cox regression
